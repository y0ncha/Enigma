# Copilot Project Instructions – Enigma Machine

## Architecture Rules
- Maintain strict separation between `machine`, `engine`, `loader`, and `ui`.
- No UI logic inside engine or machine.
- Machine contains rotor, reflector, and plugboard mechanics.
- Engine manages machine state, code setup, validation, and history.
- Loader handles XML parsing and validation only.

## Code Style
- Java 21
- Meaningful class and method names
- No static utility blobs unless necessary
- Prefer interfaces for abstractions that evolve across exercises
- Immutable models where possible (Alphabet, Mapping, Code configuration)

## Exercise Compatibility
- Exercise 1: Console + single project
- Exercise 2: Multi-module Maven; same package structure must remain stable
- Exercise 3: Spring Boot server; engine code must be service-ready (stateless or clearly stateful)

## Do Not Generate
- No package-private classes unless intentional
- No business logic inside console UI
- No direct printing from machine or engine

## Additional Notes
- Prepare for plugboard support (Exercise 2)
- Prepare for REST mapping (Exercise 3)
- Avoid hardcoding XML names or paths
